# Collaborative-Filtering-On-Movies
This notebook will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user. I will start with some basic techniques, and then use the Spark ML library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.

## Project Highlights
 * Demonstrated the end-to-end process of using Spark ML library's Alternating Least Squares method to recommend movies to a user.
 * Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on a 20 million movies rating data set.
 
## General Description
 Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly
